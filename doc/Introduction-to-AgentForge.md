# AgentForge: An Open-Source Tool That Lets AI Help You Do Research

## What Is AgentForge

AgentForge is an open-source tool that can rapidly generate research-oriented multi-agent systems (MAS). Simply put, it helps you create a "research team" composed of multiple AI agents that automatically complete data collection, analysis, and report writing for your research work.

This tool is particularly suitable for research scenarios that require extensive information gathering and analysis. For example, I use it for digital sovereignty index research, where the multi-agent system generated by AgentForge evaluates the degree of digital sovereignty independence of countries around the world. Another example: a few days ago, I used it for a regional and country studies project, conducting research and analysis on specified countries across 3 dimensions (material foundation, production relations, and human relations), 17 indicators, and 49 research items. During execution, the AI created approximately 500 specific data points and research questions based on the country's specific circumstances, obtained about 1,000 pieces of information from the internet, analyzed and generated a report, and listed which aspects still lacked information to guide future research. If a graduate student were to do this task, even just desk research on the internet, it would take at least one to two months. Running this system with Claude Code for one country took 2 hours and consumed about $7.50 worth of tokens.

AgentForge works like this: you specify your research direction and requirements across three research steps (data collection, analysis, and report writing), and AgentForge uses AI capabilities to help you form a more detailed research plan, then uses AI's data collection, analysis, and writing capabilities to help you complete the research.

## Design Principles

### Basic Research Architecture

AgentForge's design is based on a simple yet profound insight: much research work (including but not limited to academic research) can be summarized into three basic steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant materials and information
2. **Analysis**: Process and analyze the data
3. **Report Generation**: Organize analysis results into a report

These three steps constitute AgentForge's basic architecture. The system generates four agents to execute these tasks:

- **Orchestrator**: Coordinates the entire research process
- **Data Collection Agent**: Responsible for gathering information
- **Analysis Agent**: Responsible for analyzing data
- **Report Generation Agent**: Responsible for writing the final report

### Five Pillars of Knowledge Engineering

AgentForge's design is not simply "prompt engineering" but "knowledge engineering." It organizes research work around the following five key elements:

**1. Problem Orientation**
You need to define "what problem" to solve and "why solve this problem" based on real research needs. This is the fundamental starting point for all work. AgentForge clarifies this by having you fill in the `user_input.md` file.

**2. Ideology**
You need to choose what values, theoretical perspectives, or analytical frameworks to guide AI's thinking and expression. Different theoretical frameworks will guide AI to focus on different information and reach different conclusions. In AgentForge, you can reflect this in the research problem description and reference materials.

**3. Information Repository**
Effective AI application depends on high-quality information repositories. AgentForge establishes information repositories through the first step of research, "data collection," while also allowing you to provide existing reference materials, placed in the `references/` directory for AI use.

**4. Theoretical Methods**
Choosing and constructing theories and methodologies to solve problems is the core of research. AgentForge allows you to specify in detail the analytical methods you wish to employ in `user_input.md`, and the system will generate corresponding agents accordingly.

**5. Presentation Form**
The presentation of final results is important. AgentForge allows you to specify the report format (Markdown, JSON, LaTeX, etc.), structure (what parts should be included), and writing style (academic paper, policy brief, news report, etc.).

### Multi-Agent System Architecture Style

The multi-agent systems generated by AgentForge adopt a **declarative architecture** with the following characteristics:

**Declarative Rather Than Imperative**
- Agent blueprints use natural language to describe "what to achieve" and "what the standards are"
- The runtime environment (Claude Code) understands intent and intelligently chooses "how to do it"
- This brings extremely high flexibility and adaptability

**Data-Driven**
- Domain knowledge is externalized as independent reference files
- Modifying reference files can change system behavior without modifying agent blueprints
- Non-programmers can also maintain and evolve the system

**Transparent and Traceable**
- All intermediate products are completely preserved
- Data flow is clearly visible
- Humans can inspect, verify, and intervene at any stage

Specific architecture patterns include:

1. **Prompt-Defined Agents**: Use Markdown documents to define agent roles, tasks, and quality standards
2. **Orchestrated Agent Pipeline**: Tasks are decomposed into three sequential stages, data is progressively refined
3. **Filesystem Data Bus**: Agents read and write data through agreed-upon file paths, zero configuration, completely transparent
4. **Parallel Instance Execution**: When tasks can be partitioned by data, multiple agent instances are launched in parallel
5. **Reference Data Configuration**: Domain knowledge is externalized as independent files, modifying data can change system behavior

## How to Use

### Step 1: Obtain AgentForge

1. Visit AgentForge's GitHub page: https://github.com/eXtremeProgramming-cn/agent-forge
2. Click the green "Code" button
3. Select "Download ZIP" from the dropdown menu
4. After download completes, extract to your computer

### Step 2: Install Claude Code

AgentForge needs to run in the Claude Code environment. Claude Code is an AI programming assistant provided by Anthropic.

If you're not yet familiar with Claude Code, refer to these tutorials:
- **Official Quickstart Guide**: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart
- **Claude Code Getting Started Tutorial 2025**: https://fuszti.com/claude-code-setup-guide-2025/
- **Claude Code Complete Guide**: https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/claude-code

Basic steps to install and configure Claude Code:
1. Visit the Claude website (claude.ai)
2. Subscribe to Claude Pro or prepare API access credentials
3. Run the `claude` command in your terminal to start using
4. Login authentication required on first use

### Step 3: Fill in Research Project Information

Open the `user_input.md` file in the AgentForge directory and fill in your research project information as prompted:

- **Language Settings**: Choose the language for agent blueprints and report output
- **Research Topic and Core Questions**: Describe your research topic and core problems to solve
- **Data Collection Requirements**: Specify which data sources to collect information from
- **Analysis Methods**: Describe how you plan to analyze the data
- **Report Format and Style**: Specify desired report format and writing style

If you're uncertain about some questions, you can fill in "Suggested by AI" and the system will provide reasonable default solutions that you can adjust later.

### Step 4: Generate Multi-Agent System

Execute the following command in Claude Code:

```
Please read the information I filled in user_input.md,
then use the generator.md prompt,
to generate a research multi-agent system for me.
```

The system will automatically create a complete project for you, including:

```
{your-project-name}/
├── agents/                  # 4 agent blueprints
│   ├── 00.orchestrator.md
│   ├── 01.data_collector.md
│   ├── 02.analyzer.md
│   └── 03.reporter.md
├── data/                    # Data directories (three phases)
│   ├── 01.materials/
│   ├── 02.analysis/
│   └── 03.reports/
├── references/              # Reference materials
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

### Step 5: Run the System

After generation completes, execute:

```
Please use agents/00.orchestrator.md to start executing the research task
```

The system will automatically complete: data collection → analysis → report generation

You can view results in the following locations:

- Raw data in `data/01.materials/`
- Analysis results in `data/02.analysis/`
- Final report in `data/03.reports/`

### Real Case Study: Regional and Country Studies

Let me share a real use case. I recently used AgentForge for a regional and country studies project:

**Research Objective**: Establish a research system for countries worldwide

**Research Dimensions**:
- 3 dimensions: material foundation, production relations, human relations
- 17 indicators
- 49 research items

**Execution Process**:
1. AI created approximately 500 specific data points and research questions based on the country's specific circumstances
2. Obtained about 1,000 pieces of information from the internet
3. Analyzed and generated a report
4. Listed which aspects still lacked information to guide future research

**Efficiency Comparison**:
- If a graduate student does this task (desk research only): approximately 1-2 months
- Running one country's research with AgentForge: 2 hours
- Cost: approximately $7.50 (token consumption)

## Suitable Scenarios

AgentForge is particularly suitable for:

- **Information-Intensive Research**: Research requiring extensive data collection and analysis
- **Periodic Research**: Research tasks that can be repeatedly executed
- **Quality-Priority Research**: Research that can accept some time cost and values transparency and traceability

Not suitable for:

- Scenarios with extremely high real-time requirements
- Scenarios requiring absolute determinism (such as financial transactions)
- Completely offline environments

## Summary

AgentForge represents a new research paradigm: not using AI to replace researchers, but letting AI become the researcher's intelligent assistant team. Researchers are responsible for raising questions, determining directions, and setting standards, while AI handles specific data collection, analysis, and report writing.

The core value of this tool lies in:

1. **Drastically Lower Research Barriers**: No programming skills needed, just clearly describe research requirements
2. **Significantly Improve Research Efficiency**: Complete in hours what originally took weeks
3. **Ensure Research Quality**: All processes are transparent and traceable, easy to inspect and verify
4. **Support Iterative Optimization**: Can adjust research strategies based on preliminary results

If you have extensive information gathering and analysis work to complete, give AgentForge a try. It might change the way you do research.
