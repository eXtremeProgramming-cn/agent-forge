## Phase One: Data Collection

**Data Sources**:
```
[Please list the sources from which data needs to be collected. For example:
- Specific websites (list URLs)
- Social media of specific organizations
- Academic literature databases
- Government public data
- News media
- Other data sources
]
```

**Data Collection Objectives**:
```
[Please describe what information needs to be collected and how detailed it should be. For example:
- What fields/dimensions of information are needed
- How detailed each record needs to be (summary vs complete)
- Are there any information points that need special attention
]
```

**Data Collection Process Design**:
```
[Please explain if there are any special considerations for the collection process:
- Is parallel collection of multiple data sources needed?
- Is multi-stage collection needed (overview first, then deep dive)?
- Are there time range restrictions?
- Is deduplication or validation needed?
If no special requirements, answer "Suggested by AI"
]
```

**Data Storage Format**:
```
[Please specify how the collected data should be saved:
- JSON format (structured data)
- Markdown documents
- Raw files (PDF, images, etc.)
- Other formats
If no special requirements, answer "Suggested by AI"
]
```

**Existing Reference Materials**:
```
[Please list reference materials you already have that can be placed in the references directory. For example:
- Literature review of related research
- Documentation of data sources
- Glossary of related concepts
- Classification systems or standards
If none at the moment, answer "None"
]
```

## Phase Two: Analysis

**Analysis Methods**:
```
[Please describe how you plan to analyze the collected data. For example:
- Classification and statistics (categorize by certain dimension)
- Topic extraction (identify key themes and trends)
- Comparative analysis (comparison across different sources/periods)
- Relationship discovery (associations between entities)
- Qualitative analysis (deep reading and understanding)
- Other methods

If you have an existing analysis method document, please specify the filename and I will have the agent reference it.
]
```

**Analysis Process Design**:
```
[Please explain if there are any special considerations for the analysis process:
- Are multiple parallel analysis dimensions needed?
- Is multi-stage analysis needed (preliminary analysis first, then deep analysis)?
- Are there dependencies between different analyses?
If no special requirements, answer "Suggested by AI"
]
```

**Analysis Results Storage**:
```
[Please specify how the analysis results should be saved:
- JSON format (structured analysis results)
- Markdown documents (analysis reports)
- Statistical data (tables, chart data)
- Other formats
If no special requirements, answer "Suggested by AI"
]
```

## Phase Three: Report Generation

**Report Format**:
```
[Please specify the format of the final report:
- Markdown document (suitable for reading and publishing)
- JSON data (suitable for further processing)
- LaTeX academic paper
- HTML webpage
- Other formats
]
```

**Report Structure**:
```
[Please describe what parts the report should contain and what the structure is. For example:
- Abstract
- Research background
- Data source description
- Analysis findings (divided into several sections?)
- Conclusion
- Appendix

If you want AI to decide the structure based on analysis results, answer "Suggested by AI"
]
```

**Writing Style**:
```
[Please describe the writing style of the report. For example:
- Academic paper style (formal, objective, with citations)
- Policy brief style (concise, highlights key points, for decision-makers)
- News report style (narrative, easy to read)
- Technical documentation style (detailed, precise, with examples)
- Other styles

If you have a reference document for style analysis, please specify the filename (place in references/),
and I will have the Reporter agent reference it.
